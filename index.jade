    p.o-block.u-text-medium Our neural network read every comment posted to Reddit in 2015, and built a semantic map using word2vec and spaCy. Try searching for #[a(href="?word=fair%20game") a phrase] that's more than the sum of its parts to see what the model thinks it means. Try your #[a(href="?pink%20floyd") favourite band], #[a(href="?word=dtf") slang words], #[a(href="?word=fourier%20transform") technical things], or something #[a(href="?word=üëç") totally random].

    h2.u-heading-2 How does this work?

    p.o-block.u-text-medium We used #[a(href="https://spacy.io" target="_blank") spaCy] to tag and parse every comment posted to Reddit in 2015, and fed the results to Gensim's word2vec implementation. Using the search above, you can get a lot of interesting insights into the Reddit hivemind. See what spaCy and Gensim think Reddit thinks about almost anything.
